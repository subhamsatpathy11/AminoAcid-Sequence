# AminoAcid-Sequence
DNA sequence is translated into the corresponding protein sequence by using the genetic code. This process is known as DNA to protein translation. Each unique three character sequence of nucleotides, sometimes called a nucleotide triplet, corresponds to one amino acid.

# Approach
The Aminoacid character table has been designed in the code to enable the machine to learn effectively and provide the desired boolean output for the same.

# Technology and Packages
The Technicalities are,

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python3
- File functions

# Conclusion
As a result of the user input provided, we received the boolean output as "True". Therefore, the code is executed successfully and functioning well with respect to the demanded output.
